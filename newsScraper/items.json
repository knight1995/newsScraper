It has taken the first step towards putting in place legally enforceable habitat standards to promote green urban development. Regulations and control measures are effective policy instruments, but new ones will matter little if nothing has been achieved with what already exists. The Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC), which could help reduce energy consumption by about 1.7 billion units of electricity a year, came into being four years ago. It remains voluntary, and is applicable only to large commercial buildings. Barring Orissa, no State has so far adopted it. Policymakers who argue that India has modelled itself on countries such as United Kingdom, which have kept the codes for sustainable buildings voluntary, are conveniently overlooking other innovations adopted by them to push their efforts forward. For instance, in the U.K., where about 42 per cent of all carbon emissions come from buildings, owners must produce Energy Performance Certificates of their properties put up for sale or rent. This helps buyers or tenants to choose efficient properties, which in turn ensures that the building design and construction are environmentally responsible.", "author": "abcde"},

But the real question is what progress has been made on women's rights since the fall of the Taliban. During the five years the Taliban reigned over Afghanistan from 1996, women were subjected to atrocities and repression of the kind the world thought had ended with the medieval ages. When they were ousted in 2001, much was made of the promise the moment held for Afghan women for the first time since the 1980s, when the country descended into war. But more than a decade later, and under the west-backed Hamid Karzai goverrnment, the ground situation has shown little improvement. The recent rescue of a 15-year-old girl held captive for months in a toilet by her in-laws who had broken her fingers, pulled out her finger nails, and tortured her for resisting their attempts to prostitute her is a chilling reality check on all the upbeat buzz about Afghan women participating in public life, being recruited in the armed forces, holding fashion shows, and attending pop music concerts. The brutal truth is that for a majority of women in Afghanistan, cultural norms of \u2018honour' and \u2018shame' and customary practices of using women to settle disputes, combined with the general lawlessness spawned by the prolonged conflict, have ensured a life of deep insecurity.", "author": "abcde"},
